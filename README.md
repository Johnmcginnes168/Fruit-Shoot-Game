# üçç Fruit Shoot

A simple and fun game built using [Pygame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) where your goal is to click the pineapple to earn points‚Äîwithout hitting the apple!

---

##  How to Play

- Click on the **pineapple** to increase your score.
- Click on the **apple** and lose a point (rude).
- Click **anywhere else** and be reminded you missed!
- Reach **more than 10 points** to win‚Äîor drop below 0 to lose.
- After game over, click anywhere to **restart** and try again.

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame Zero (`pip install pgzero`)

### Run the Game

You can run the game in **two ways**:

#### üñ± Option 1: Double-click the Python file  
If your system is set up to run `.py` files, you can just **double-click `pineapple_shooter.py`** to start the game.  
*(Make sure your images folder is in the same directory.)*

####  Option 2: Run from terminal

```bash
pgzrun pineapple_shooter.py
```

This is the recommended method, especially if you're making changes or debugging.

Make sure your `images/` folder contains:
- `pineapple.png`
